# 🚀 Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), providing you with a powerful starting point for building modern React applications.

## 📜 Available Scripts

In your project directory, the following commands are available:

### **`npm start`**

- Launches the app in development mode.\
  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
  
- The page **automatically reloads** when you make changes.
  
- You may also see **lint errors** in the console.

---

### **`npm test`**

- Starts the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
  For more details, visit the section on [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

---

### **`npm run build`**

- Builds the app for **production** in the `build` folder.
  
- React is bundled in **production mode** and optimized for the **best performance**.
  
- Filenames are **hashed** and the build is **minified**.

Your app is now ready to be deployed! 🎉 \

### **`npm run eject`** ⚠️

> **Warning:** This is a **one-way operation**. Once you `eject`, there’s no going back!

- Removes the single build dependency and copies all the configuration files and dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly to your project.
  
- This allows **full control** over the setup, but you’re on your own for future updates.

- You should only `eject` if you need to customize the setup beyond what Create React App provides out of the box.
